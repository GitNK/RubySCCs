# RubySCCs
Calculate strongly connected components on big directed graph (5 million edges) using Kosarajuâ€™s Two-Pass Algorithm

> Graph data is in file `_SCC.txt`. It containce 5,105,043 edges and 875,714 verticies.

> Algorithm calculates SCCs and finds 5 lagrest from them. The correct answer is: 434821,968,459,313,211

> I've also added some RSPEC tests for Graph data structure. 

Be aware, graph is big enough and takes some ram, up to 800M.
